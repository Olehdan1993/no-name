    The <b>United States of America (USA)</b>, commonly known as the <b>United States</b> (U.S. or US) or <b>America</b>,
    is a country
    composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.[f] At 3.8
    million square miles (9.8 million km2), the United States is the world's third or fourth largest country by total
    area[g] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe's 3.9 million square miles (10.1 million km2).
    With a population of over 327 million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country. The capital is
    <em>Washington, D.C.,</em> and the largest city by population is <em>New York City</em>. Forty-eight states and the
    capital's federal
    district are contiguous in North America between Canada and Mexico. The State of Alaska is in the northwest corner
    of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west. The State of
    Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and
    the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and
    wildlife of the United States make it one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries.[20]

    Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago.[21] European
    colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established
    along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War
    led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war
    ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power.[22] The
    current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights,
    being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous
    expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories,[23] displacing Native
    American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.[23]

        It has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the
        Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago however, increasing evidence suggests an even earlier
        arrival.[21][51][52] After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward along the Pacific
        coast[53]
        and through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.[54] The Clovis
        culture
        appeared around 11,000 BC, and is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the
        Americas.[55] The Clovis culture was believed to represent the first human settlement of the Americas.[56] Over
        the
        years, more and more evidence has advanced the idea of "pre-Clovis" cultures including tools dating back about
        15,550 years ago. It is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into North
        America.[57]</p>

    <p>Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian
        Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level
        societies.[58] The Mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 AD, extending from the Mexican
        border down through Florida.[59] Its city state Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian
        archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[60] In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloans culture
        developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation which produced greater dependence on
        farming.[61] Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: Mesa Verde
        National
        Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, and Taos Pueblo.[62][63] The earthworks constructed by Native
        Americans of the Poverty Point culture in northeastern Louisiana have also been designated a UNESCO World
        Heritage
        site. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point
        between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.[64]</p>

    <p>The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of continuing debate.[65] Archaeological
        evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD.</p>

    <h2>Effects on and interaction with native populations</h2>
    <em>Further information: American Indian Wars, Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas, and James
        Cook</em>
    <p>While estimating the original native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult,
        an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by James Mooney using historic records to
        estimate the indigenous population north of Mexico in 1600.[68][69] In more recent years, Douglas H. Ubelaker of
        the Smithsonian Institution has updated these figures.[70] While Ubelaker estimated that there was a population
        of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states, most academics regard the
        figure as too low.[68] Anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns believed that the populations were much higher, suggestion
        1,100,000 along the shores of the gulf of Mexico, 2,211,000 people living between Florida and Massachusetts,
        5,250,000 in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries and 697,000 people in the Florida peninsula.[68][69]</p>

    <p>The first interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was made by the Norsemen. A number of surviving
        Norse sagas provide information regarding The Maritimes and its indigenous people. The Norse attempted to settle
        in North America about 500 years before Columbus.[71][72][73]</p>

    <p>In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks
        from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans
        in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other.
        Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[74] Natives
        taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash. European missionaries and others
        felt it was important to "civilize" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural
        techniques and lifestyles.[75][76]</p>
