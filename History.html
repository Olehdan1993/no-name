Monks Mound, in Cahokia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site

The Cliff Palace, built by the Ancestral Puebloans
It has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the
Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago however, increasing evidence suggests an even earlier
arrival.[21][51][52] After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward along the Pacific coast[53]
and through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.[54] The Clovis culture
appeared around 11,000 BC, and is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the
Americas.[55] The Clovis culture was believed to represent the first human settlement of the Americas.[56] Over the
years, more and more evidence has advanced the idea of "pre-Clovis" cultures including tools dating back about
15,550 years ago. It is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into North America.[57]

Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian
Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level
societies.[58] The Mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 AD, extending from the Mexican
border down through Florida.[59] Its city state Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian
archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[60] In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloans culture
developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation which produced greater dependence on
farming.[61] Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: Mesa Verde National
Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, and Taos Pueblo.[62][63] The earthworks constructed by Native
Americans of the Poverty Point culture in northeastern Louisiana have also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage
site. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point
between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.[64]
